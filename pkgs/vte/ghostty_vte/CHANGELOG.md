# Changelog

## 0.1.5

- Source builds now stage and patch an isolated Ghostty tree in the hook output
  directory, leaving the provided checkout unchanged.
- Added `GhosttyVt.codepointWidth`, `GhosttyVt.measureGraphemeCluster`, and
  `GhosttyVt.displayWidth`, which measure text with the terminal's own width
  table and grapheme segmentation. Available on both the native and wasm paths.
- Added the terminal selection API: `selectWord`, `selectWordBetween`,
  `selectLine`, `selectAll`, `selectOutput`, `formatSelection`,
  `adjustSelection`, `selectionOrder`, `selectionOrdered`, `selectionContains`,
  and `selectionsEqual`, with `VtSelection` owning the native snapshot. Native
  only: the wasm path does not carry grid references, which this API is
  addressed by.
- No new prebuilts: these symbols are already in the `ghostty_vte-v0.1.4`
  binaries, which were built from the same Ghostty revision.

## 0.1.4

- Updated the bundled Ghostty to `2dd79f3`, which brings upstream VT throughput
  and render-state work, scrollback page compression, and fixes for a UTF-8
  grapheme length overflow, an integer overflow in `selectPrev`, and page
  capacity errors in `eraseRow` and `cursorScrollAbove`.
- **Breaking (native ABI):** building this package now requires Zig 0.16.0.
  `ghostty_terminal_new` lost `GhosttyTerminalOptions`, so the scrollback budget
  is applied through `ghostty_terminal_set`. The Dart API is unchanged:
  `VtTerminal(cols:, rows:, maxScrollback:)` still takes a byte budget.
- Fixed a local checkout downloading the pinned release prebuilt instead of
  building its own ghostty submodule, which could link a library whose ABI did
  not match the generated bindings.
- Fixed `GhosttyFormatterTerminalOptions` being allocated 4 bytes short on the
  wasm path, which had libghostty read its trailing `selection` pointer from
  past the end of the allocation.
- Fixed `buildInfo.versionBuild` returning the pre-release string on the wasm
  path.

## 0.1.3

- Added iOS device and simulator prebuilt target support for `libghostty-vt`
  build and verification workflows.
- Fixed pub-cache detection in the build hook so Windows installs under
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pub\Cache` use downloaded prebuilts instead of falling back
  to a source build.

## 0.1.2

- Updated `ghostty_vte:setup` to default to the shared build-hook
  `releaseTag`, so the manual prebuilt downloader stays aligned with the
  native-asset hook release being used by downstream apps.

## 0.1.1

- Graduated the staged `0.1.1-dev` VT/runtime updates as the stable `0.1.1`
  release.
- Synced the bundled Ghostty checkout to the latest VT headers, regenerated
  the FFI bindings, and updated the local binding generator to use the
  `ffigen` API directly.
- Added bundled source patch application in the build hook so Android source
  builds can apply the `libghostty-vt` libc-link fix without carrying a dirty
  Ghostty submodule checkout.
- Added high-level wrappers for the new VT APIs:
  `GhosttyVt.buildInfo`, `GhosttyVt.encodePaste*`, and terminal default and
  effective color theme accessors on both native and web.
- Added shared web-side helpers for higher-level consumers: `VtModes`,
  `VtMouseEncoderOptions`, render-color resolvers, `VtFormatter*Extra.all()`,
  and a safe `VtTerminal.getMode()` fallback on web.

## 0.1.0+2

- Added shared web-side helpers for higher-level consumers: `VtModes`,
  `VtMouseEncoderOptions`, render-color resolvers, `VtFormatter*Extra.all()`,
  and a safe `VtTerminal.getMode()` fallback on web.
- Fixed local prebuilt resolution to ignore invalid `.prebuilt/` candidates
  before falling back to downloaded assets or a source build.
- Build-hook progress now logs to stdout and uses `Warning:` for non-fatal
  fallback paths, avoiding false `ERROR:` prefixes in Flutter builds.

## 0.1.0+1

- Fixed Linux/macOS/Windows prebuilt artifact selection to only package the
  real dynamic library, not the similarly named static archive.
- Added dynamic-library header validation in the build hook and setup tooling
  so broken release artifacts fail fast instead of surfacing as runtime FFI
  load errors.
- `dart run ghostty_vte:setup` now clears stale `hooks_runner` cache entries so
  the next app build picks up the extracted prebuilt library.
- Updated `ghostty_vte:setup` to default to the current `releaseTag` artifacts.

## 0.1.0

- **BREAKING**: `resize()` now requires `cellWidthPx` and `cellHeightPx`
  parameters (matching ghostty's updated 5-arg `ghostty_terminal_resize`).
- Updated ghostty submodule from `efb352359` to `bebca8466` (162 upstream
  commits) with major API expansion.
- Regenerated FFI bindings (4747 → 5484 lines).
- All 8 terminal effect callbacks via `NativeCallable.isolateLocal`:
  `onBell`, `onWritePty`, `onTitleChanged`, `onSize`, `onColorScheme`,
  `onDeviceAttributes`, `onEnquiry`, `onXtversion`.
- Terminal data getters: `title`, `pwd`, `mouseTracking`, `totalRows`,
  `scrollbackRows`, `widthPx`, `heightPx`.
- New types: `VtDeviceAttributes`, `VtColorScheme`, `VtSizeReportSize`.
- Updated zig build step from `lib-vt` to `-Demit-lib-vt=true`.

## 0.0.3+1

- Auto-download prebuilt native libraries from GitHub Releases during
  the build hook — no more manual `dart run ghostty_vte:setup` required.
- Build hook resolution order: env var → local `.prebuilt/` → auto-download
  (cached in `outputDirectoryShared`) → build from source.
- SHA256 hash verification of downloaded artifacts.
- Fixed `_findPrebuiltInProjectRoots()` to also match directories with
  `pubspec.yaml` + `pkgs/` (monorepo/workspace roots).
- Updated setup script default tag to `v0.0.3`.

## 0.0.2

- Added `dart run ghostty_vte:setup` command to download prebuilt native
  libraries for downstream consumers.
- Build hook now finds prebuilt libraries at the consuming project's
  `.prebuilt/<platform>/` directory, eliminating the need to modify the
  pub cache.
- Build hook search order: env var, monorepo `.prebuilt/`, project `.prebuilt/`.

## 0.0.1+1

- Bumped package version to `0.0.1+1`.

## 0.0.1

- Initial release.
- Dart FFI bindings for Ghostty's libghostty-vt.
- Paste-safety checking via `GhosttyVt.isPasteSafe()`.
- OSC (Operating System Command) streaming parser.
- SGR (Select Graphic Rendition) attribute parser.
- Keyboard event encoding (legacy, xterm, Kitty protocol).
- Web support via WebAssembly.
- Prebuilt library support — skip Zig with downloaded binaries.
